## A formal data set verification tool.
This repository contains the information for a formal data set verification tool, as descried in our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.10822).

The directory [properties](./properties) contains example properties in the *SMT-LIB* language. Those properties are the following:
- balanced -- a formula that checks that the data set has a balanced set of labels
- contradicting  
- min\_100\_ex  
- min\_max  
- well\_distributed
